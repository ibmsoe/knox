The purpose of the samples within this directory is to demonstrate the capabilities
of the Apache Knox Gateway to provide access to the numerous APIs that are available
from the service components of a Hadoop cluster.

Depending on exactly how your Knox installation was done, there will be some number of
steps required in order fully install and configure the samples for use in your environment.

Please see the following section within the Apache Knox Users Guide:
